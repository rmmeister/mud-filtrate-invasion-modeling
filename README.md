# mud-filtrate-invasion-modeling
Modeling of mud filtrate invasion into core samples.
Both dynamic and static linear filter-cake model have been established.

1. The filtrate concentration profile can be drawn for 14 sets of cores separately within the program.

2. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis on every parameter for user-defined values is available in the program.

3. Error analysis is carried out to determine the amount of deviation of the model from experimental data.

The intructions should be given through the command window which is fairly easy to interact with.
